1You find a haunted house.
1Just like everything else in this sad carnival, it's empty, but hey, maybe it has something.
1You enter the house and witness some poorly designed animatronics.
1This place really hasn't been as scary without Spook Skellybones.
1Anyway, in a surprise turn of events, you see two very spooky zombies and a very spooky ghost traversing the house.
1You try to get their attention by waving at them.
1They look back and look very offended.
1"Excuse me?" says one of the zombies.
1"Yeah, what are you trying to say?" says another zombie.
1I should have mentioned, waving here in spookyland is an incredible sign of disrespect.
1You literally dug up and destroyed their grave and they would have been less offended.
1"I can't believe you!" says the ghost.
1The ghost continues, "David, can you show them what you're made of? Heehee!"
1David nods.
1Oops.
