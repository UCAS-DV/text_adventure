1Zeep Vorp's mech explodes and he ejects himself out, never to be seen again.
1He leaves behind the page of the constitution though.
1The Vice President picks it up,
1"You've done good work today."
1Days later, a firework show is being held in your honor.
1Creatures from across EMUSA come together to celebrate your honor.
1After collecting you awards and accolades, you sit on a peaceful hill, above all of the commotion.
1"Raaaah, thank you honored one" you hear behind you.
1You turn around to see Mr. Skellybones on one knee.
1"The people of Spookyland owe you their eternal gratitude."
1"Thank you, honored one."
1"Thank you for saving my land."
1"My father would be proud."
1"Hey!" you hear another familiar voice.
1It's Pepper.
1"Governor Claus would like to apologize for his actions, and I would too."
1"Governor Claus and I lost track of our Christmas spirit and we will never make the mistakes we made again"
1She also gets on one knee.
1You know what,
1thank you too.
1You've shown me the greatest adventure any voice can ever imagine.
1Pepper and Mr. Skellybones sit beside you as the firework show begins.
1You're mesmerized by the flashing colors of the sky.
1Maybe this is what this was about.
1Maybe it was never about the $20 gift card.
1Maybe the true Quest for the Country,
1is the friends we made along the way.
1...
1...
1...
1Who am I kidding?
1It's about that juicy giftcard!
1The End.
