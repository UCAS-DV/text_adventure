1I'm sure you're already familiar with how health works.
1But people often underestimate how important it is to keep a cool head.
1You see, if you let your nerves get too low, your attacks' effectiveness will likely be greatly reduced.
1or worse, 
1they'll completely fail.
1If you keep cool and have high nerves, your attacks won't only be likely to land properly,
1they may even be more powerful.
1The same goes for your enemies.
1So make sure to maintain high nerves for yourself, and reduce their nerves.
1Don't worry if you get too nervous,
1you will likely have items you collect from bosses or locations that you can use as hail marys,
1regardless of your nerves.
1Although, you can only use them once,
1so be conservative with your item use.
1Also, if things get too bad,
1there's a minimum value your nerves can fall under.
1Although sadly, your enemies also have a minimum nerves value.
1Now that we have that settled,
1let's begin!
1I'll be your first boss so you can apply your new knowledge.
