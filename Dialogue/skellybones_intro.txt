1After enjoying the carnival games, you witness a small crowd gather around the entrance.
1You curiously head to the entrance to witness a buggy being carried by skeleton horses commanded by very dapper zombies.
1The horses stop walk parallel to the entrance and stop.
1The carriage opens, revealing a gigantic skeleton dressed in a suit and tie.
1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1Sorry,
1I got a little scared
1You can't figure out who the skeleton.
1It exits the buggy, standing at least 8 feet tall. As it walks into the carnival,
1it trips.
1"YEEEEEEEEEOUUUUUUUCH!"
1It jumps up as it hits the 207th bone of the body,
1the funny bone.
1"Please pardon me..."
1"I meant to say,"
1"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1Sorry, I got a little spooked.
1Anyways, in its hand it holds a hat.
1Once you put it on...
1It seems that its no "it",
1He's Mr. Skellybones.
1He reaches into his hat and pulls out an old piece of parchement,
1a page of the constitution.
`Ask for the page politely`
